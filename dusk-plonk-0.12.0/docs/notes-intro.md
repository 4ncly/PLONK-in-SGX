This module is a self contained file which explains
how PLONK and its protocol components work in our library.

Table of Contents
=================

The following section explains the workings of PLONK components:
* [Commitment schemes](notes-commitments.md#commitment-schemes)
* [Proof construction components](notes-prove-verify.md#plonk-proof-construction)
* [Permutation polynomials](notes-prove-verify.md#lagrangian-polynomials)



This section explains how elements of the aggregated PLONK protocol work
and some of the unique features in this library:

* [Prover and Verify algorithms](prove_verify/index.html)
* [Unbalanced permutation arguments](unbalanced_perm_args/index.html)
* [KZG10 commitment scheme](kzg10_docs/index.html)
